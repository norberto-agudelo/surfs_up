# Surfs_up Analysis. Module 9
## Overview 

Somebody who visited Hawaii and wanted to live there wanted to open a surf and shake shop to serve locals and tourists. He reached out and investor who loves surf but he needs to have more information about weather because he failed on a former business due to lack of enough data and information.

After generating some reports and information about weather and temperatures observed at several stations, the investor wanted more information about temperature trends in Oahu, a beautiful island where the shop could be opened.  He wants to have temperature data for the months of June and December in order to know if the new business is sustainable year-round.

So, it was necessary to create weather statistics summaries for those months in order to analyze trends make decisions based on real data.

## Results

•	Taking in account 1700 observations, the average temperature in June is around 75°F. The highest temperature was 85°F and the lowest one was 64°F. However, is important to mention that the most of the observations were temperatures around 77°F.

•	There were less observations in December but the sample is representative in order to compare it with June results. With 1517 observations, the average temperature in December was around 71°F which is close to the temperature on June, 75°F. The highest temperature was 83°F and the lowest one was 56°F.

•	In June, the range of temperature observed was 21°F (85-64) while in December was 27°F. It means that temperature in June is steadier and a surf and shake business could be wealthier that month.  Nevertheless, the change between temperatures observed in December is not a big range it doesn’t represent a big risk for the shop successful.

## Summary
. 
•	Two additional queries were performed to graph June and December weather data trend. With these lines of code two histograms’ charts were built as showed below

•	As a result of the data gathered, we can affirm that Oahu is a very good location to start a new surf and shake business because the most of the time temperature is high which guaranties the successful of it. 
•	Although there are some differences between June and December temperature, they are not representative. So, its possible affirm that temperature is good to support the shop all the year.

•	Low temperatures are not very common. The most of the observations are temperatures between 70° and 80° in June and around between 65° and 77° which is good enough for this type of business.
